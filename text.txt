1. created new repository from local
2. now we have to push locally created repo to the remote git hub acct
3. check out the process for the same:


new update-> commit 2
we have already pushed the above matter , now its going for second commit

1. as we have already made a commite and pushed the text file, whicle doing it for second time we can simply push the commits as simple command like
"git push"
there is no need to mention like -> "git push origin main"

commit-> 3

But to have the above to happen in short push command, we must have to set the upstream first 
using the mentioned command "git push --set-upstrem origin main"
